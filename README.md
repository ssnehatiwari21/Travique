# Travique 

**Travique** is a full-stack travel accommodation platform that allows users to discover destinations, create property listings, upload images, view locations on interactive maps, and share reviews.

Built using the **MVC Architecture**, the project demonstrates backend development, authentication, database design, cloud storage integration, and geolocation services.

## Architecture

The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:

```text
Models       → Database Logic
Views        → User Interface (EJS)
Controllers  → Business Logic
Routes       → Request Handling
```

This architecture improves code organization, maintainability, and scalability.
